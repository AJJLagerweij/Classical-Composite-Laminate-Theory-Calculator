Introduction
============
This file containts functions to determine the if the loaded laminate fails
acording to one of the following failure criteria:

- Max stress
- Tsai-Wu
- Tsai-Hill

.. note::
   An extension is planned for the Puck critria and some 'inverse' method.
   These inverse methods will return a scaling factor of which the load can be
   multiplied with before failure is reached.
