#Classical Composite Laminate Theory Calculator#

This set of scrips contains functions that can be used for the design of simple fibre composite laminates. The goal of this project is to create a open-source laminate theory calculator something that can compete with “The Laminator”. There are two benefits of the project in python is that it can easily be integrated in, for example, a stiffend plate buckling/cripling calculator. Or that it can be used to find the optimal layout by iterating over various designs.
